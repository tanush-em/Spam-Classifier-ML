# Spam-Classifier-ML
This project is a machine learning-based spam classifier designed to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages in SMS and emails. 
It utilizes libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and frameworks including scikit-learn, Streamlit, and pickle for model deployment and usage.

Utilizes Machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn for classification.
Provides scripts/notebooks for data preprocessing, training, and model evaluation.
Includes a Streamlit-based interface for model deployment.
Uses NLTK for text preprocessing and manipulation.

Contributions are welcomed, but proper documentation and reasoning is expected :)
